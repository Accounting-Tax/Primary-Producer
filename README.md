# Primary Producers 2024

## What is Primary Production?
- Defined under s.995-1(1) as a business involving:
  - Cultivating plants, fungi, or their produce.
  - Maintaining animals for sale or their bodily produce.
  - Fishing and forest operations.
  - Manufacturing dairy produce from raw materials produced by the taxpayer.

## Primary Production Income
Primary production income includes proceeds from the sale of produce, livestock, stud fees, prize money, insurance recoveries, agistment fees, and primary produce taken for domestic use.

## Averaging of Income
- Due to seasonal factors, primary producers often face income fluctuations. Averaging provisions allow income and tax payable to be spread over a maximum of five years.
- Eligibility includes individuals, partners, or trustees engaged in primary production for at least two years.
- Averaging involves granting a tax offset when taxable income exceeds average income or imposing extra tax when taxable income is less than average income.

## Special Deductions
A number of deductions are available to primary producers for capital costs:
- **Telephone Lines**: Deduction over ten equal annual instalments for extending telephone lines.
- **Water Facilities and Fencing**: Immediate deduction (100%) for water facilities and fencing expenditure.
- **Landcare Operations**: 100% deduction for capital costs on landcare operations (e.g., soil conservation, pest eradication, and weed destruction).
- **Fodder Storage**: Deductible over three years for eligible fodder storage assets like silos and hay sheds.

## Farm Management Deposits Scheme (FMD)
- Allows primary producers to reduce tax effects caused by fluctuating incomes by making deposits that are tax-deductible.
- Deposits cannot exceed $800,000, and withdrawals are assessable in the year of withdrawal.

## Horticultural Plants
- Depreciation deductions are available for acquiring and planting horticultural plants. The write-off rate depends on the effective life of the plants, ranging from 7% to 40%.

## Livestock Valuation
- The closing value of livestock is determined using cost, market selling value, or replacement price.
- Natural increases in livestock are assigned a value when first brought to account.

## Profit from Death or Forced Disposal
- When livestock is disposed of due to events like compulsory acquisition or natural disasters, the profit is assessable income.
- Taxpayers may elect to either spread the profit over five years or defer it by offsetting the cost of replacement stock.

## Insurance Recoveries
- Insurance recoveries for loss of livestock or timber due to disasters may be spread over five years.
